  
  MU finds whether you can derive one string from another, using the
  rules printed in Hofstadter's 'Godel, Escher, Bach:..' using a
  breadth-first, brute-force method (now with added cores!).

  Arguments:
    1st argument is the number of derivation cycles to compute.
    2nd argument is the starting string.
    3rd argument is the string you want to achieve.
    4th argument is the number of processors to use. Defaults to 1 if blank.
    
  i.e.  To run 50 cycles with 2 cores and see if it produces 'MI' from 'MU',
        (hint - it doesn't) then at the command line, while in the right
        directory, type:

        ./MU 50 'MU' 'MI' 2"
